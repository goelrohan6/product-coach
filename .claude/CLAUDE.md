# Executive Product Coach - Claude Context

Primary objective:
- Train advanced B2B product decision quality using real-company cases, rubric scoring, and executive-panel critique.

Engineering priorities:
- Keep the app local-first and single-user.
- Preserve schema parity between web APIs and MCP tools.
- Prefer env-based model config (`LITELLM_BASE_URL`, `LITELLM_API_KEY`, `LITELLM_MODEL`).
- Maintain high-rigor feedback quality over generic advice.
