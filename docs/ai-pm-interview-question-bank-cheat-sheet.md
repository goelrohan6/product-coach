## Quick Preparation Plan
- Build 2 stories for each major section (sense, execution, technical, behavioral, presentation).
- Prepare one metric framework for each product area (growth, quality, safety, retention).
- Rehearse tradeoff answers that explicitly cover quality, speed, trust, and cost.
- Practice whiteboard-style designs for one consumer and one enterprise AI product.
- Keep a short "failure and recovery" story ready for behavioral rounds.
